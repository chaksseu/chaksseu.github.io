I am a master's student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University, working in the [Multimodal Interactive Intelligence Laboratory (MIIL)](https://miil.korea.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Prof. Paul Hongsuck Seo.

My research interests lie in the field of multimodal generative models, with a particular focus on diffusion-based approaches for audio-visual understanding and generation. I am broadly interested in exploring how different modalities can be aligned, fused, and generated through modern deep learning frameworks.

I am currently involved in developing methods for scalable and robust multimodal generation using both modality-specific architectures and cross-modal reasoning.
